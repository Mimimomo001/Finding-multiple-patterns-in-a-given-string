the Rabin-Karp algorithm offers significant improvements over the Naive Pattern-Matching algorithm. However, there are several extensions that can be made to the Rabin-Karp algorithm to further expand its functionalities to handle even more interesting inputs.

For example, instead of looking up a single pattern in a string, we can choose to look for an entire list of different patterns in a string, or even multiple strings. Similarly, we can also break new ground in the concept of pattern-matching by taking a leap from the usual one-dimensional search into two dimensions!
